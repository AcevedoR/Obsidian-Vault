when choosing a technology everybody knows that in your decision making you should consider (in importance order):
- fit to business usecase
- performance
- team knowledge/capacity to learn (see innovation tokens)
- quality of documentation
- community (google searches, github stars, recent github issues, recent github commits)

but sometimes the Innovation aspect, documentation and community are the most critical points............
